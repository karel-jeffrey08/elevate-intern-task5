# My Learnings from Task 5

This task was a valuable practical exercise in performing a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow. Here are some of the key skills and concepts I practiced and reinforced:

### Technical Skills

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** I gained hands-on experience in handling missing data by using different strategies, such as imputing with the median (`Age`) and mode (`Embarked`), and deciding when to drop a column (`Cabin`).
- **Data Visualization:** I used `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to create a variety of plots. I learned how to choose the right type of plot for different kinds of analysis:
  - `countplot` for categorical data distribution.
  - `histplot` for understanding the distribution of a continuous variable like age.
  - `heatmap` to visualize correlations between multiple numerical features at once.
- **Using Jupyter/Google Colab:** I became more comfortable with the notebook environment, including organizing code into cells, using markdown for documentation, and generating outputs in a structured way.

### Analytical Skills

- **Asking Questions of the Data:** The task taught me to think like an analystâ€”starting with broad questions (like "What was the overall survival rate?") and narrowing down to more specific ones (like "How did survival differ between classes?").
- **Interpreting Visualizations:** I learned to not just create plots, but to also interpret what they mean and translate the visual information into actionable insights and clear written observations.
- **Storytelling with Data:** By organizing the notebook with code, plots, and explanations, I practiced telling a coherent story about the data, guiding the reader through the analysis from start to finish.

Overall, this project was a great end-to-end experience that solidified my understanding of the fundamental EDA process.
